\section{Second Member}
This is the section dedicated to one of the team members, and it should be written individually . It can include a range of things; first subsection is a space for you to point out the strengths and weaknesses of the module, including complaints about the module coordinator Max Wilson. The second section should have a selfie image with Max! The last part of it is the most important one. You will need to write a paragraph about what you have learned in this module. You can write it in \textbf{Bold} if you want or you can use other fonts. 

Please do not forget:
\begin{itemize}
	\item First paragraph should have your comments about the module
	\item Second one, a selfie img with Max
	\item Last one, what you learned in this module.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Comments about the module}
The FSE module has been very enjoyable. Despite me hearing that other students think it is the most boring module in terms of content, I do find some of it quite interesting, and the presentations from Max are well made and thought out. However, one thing I am not a fan of is the large number of expected reading set for the module. It's difficult to know what will important in the exam when given 5 pages of dense text in a pdf to read after every lecture.

\subsection{Selfie with Max}

\subsection{What I have learned in this module}
In this module I have learnt about the various stages in the software engineering process as well as the different methodologies and strategies involved in creating successful software as a team.

Although we haven't done any real coding as teams as of yet, I have learnt a lot about how to work as team through the weekly lab sessions.
